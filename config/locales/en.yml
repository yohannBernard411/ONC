      titre1: "Threads, Wools and other materials "
      titre2: "What to choose?"
      texte1: "Cc, you know my ideas on the subject also I will give you the topo on synthetic knitting yarns, you will find acrylic, nylon and polyamide, polyester, lurex (a rare exception that you can find in my designs). The advantage of these materials is their ease of maintenance, their low cost. Their drawbacks are little thermal quality (damage for a sweater), they come from petrochemicals and even once produced, they continue to pollute with each washing via wastewater, the microparticles which emerge from them pass through the filters. sewage treatment plants to end up in the sea."
      texte2: "Natural knitting yarns are made from spun animal or plant fibers, commonly called wool. The advantage is their thermal and breathable quality, and that they do not take on an odor, you just need to ventilate your sweater, no need to wash it every time you wear it, the disadvantage is precisely the washing because the wools can felt under the effect of the sudden change in temperature and the movements of the drum of the machine. A process exists to avoid this, it is Superwash (SW) wools, but this process uses a lot of chemicals and water so it has a strong impact on the environment as much as you know. Unlike animal fibers, plant fibers are not very elastic."
      soustitre1: "The different animal fibers:"
      strong1: "The wool of sheep"
      liste1: ", sheep and lamb come from the shearing of fleeces. According to the races they will be more or less gentle. Also pay attention to their origin, the sheep can be in Australia / South America, the wool washed and processed in China and the spinning in France. Merino is very soft and in France Arles merino, there is also Ouessant, Shetland ... The structure of the wool gives it good elasticity, moreover it has a shape memory which prevents deformation over time. It is wrinkle-resistant and easy to dye. It has many thermal qualities and allows the body to keep a constant temperature, and lets the skin breathe, and allows perspiration to escape."
      strong2: "Angora and cashmere wool"
      liste2: ", come from goats. Cashmere comes from Himalayan goats, it is the undercoat of the fleece. It is very fine, soft and with very efficient thermal qualities. Angora goats provide the mohair that we find classified in different categories according to its finesse, the finest being the kid-mohair (from kids). This wool swells with air as soon as it gets cold, which gives it exceptional thermal qualities. France offers a wide variety of them thanks to our artisanal breeding. It is often found associated with silk in the form of Kid-silk."
      strong3: "Angora rabbit wool"
      liste3: ": It is an extremely soft fiber and up to 9 times warmer than sheep's wool. You have to pay attention to the origin and the conditions of harvest , in Germany the rabbits are shorn, in France to comb with a comb, in Asia the rabbit is sacrificed. So pay attention to your suppliers, and go to Caregora angora (strict respect for animal welfare, with European certification)."
      strong4: "Alpaca wool"
      liste4: ", very soft, warm, light and resistant, it is a high-end fiber. Baby alpaca fiber is ideal for sensitive skin, especially for layettes. Many breedings have developed in France."
      strong5: "Yak wool" 
      liste5: ", it has qualities similar to cashmere, softness to the touch and warmth.It is a fairly rare fiber that can only be harvested in an artisanal way in spring by weeding because the animal naturally loses its hair. It is often found woven with silk or lambswool."
      strong6: "Camel wool"
      liste6: ", taken from the down of the camel, it is extremely rare. By virtue of its qualities, it is very similar to yak wool."
      strong7: "silk"
      liste7: ": it is a protein fiber resulting from the cocoon produced by the caterpillar of the mulberry bombyx for that of culture and of Tussah for wild silk. It gives a brilliant rendering to the Its advantages are its natural elasticity, its solidity, its ability to absorb dyes, and its thermoregulation, lets the skin breathe in summer and warms in winter. It is often found mixed with other fibers such as mohair."
      soustitre2: "The different natural plant fibers:"
      texte3: "Materials which, unlike animal fibers, have the advantage of being generally machine washed. And vegans to dress naturally."
      strong21: "Cotton"
      liste21: ". The most widespread, and also controversial given the ecological damage caused, a lot of pesticides and very water consuming. Choose those that are GOTS certified. It is absorbent and insulating, and is very resistant to washing even at high temperatures. It is soft, but can be heavy to wear and warm."
      strong22: "Linen"
      liste22: ": long neglected in favor of cotton, we see it come back to the fore for its culture which requires little fertilizer and water. It is very solid, thermoregulatory, very light. Its rough side fades with washing."
      strong23: "Bamboo"
      liste23: ", very absorbent, it rivals cotton, much easier to grow. It is soft and comfortable, and very resistant, it can replace nylon in the manufacture of socks. It is slippery and quite heavy. Look at its origin, the growing conditions are not the same in Europe as in Asia."
      strong24: "Soy"
      liste24: ", a fiber that I know very little about, apparently artificial because it is regenerated from the proteins contained in the seeds, it is what does a lot of transformation work. It is as shiny as silk, hypoallergenic, washable and resists light and sweat."
      strong25: "Hemp"
      liste25: ": fiber from the Middle Ages which regains its letters of nobility, for its rapid and productive cultivation with little water, fertilizers and pesticides. Quite similar to flax, it is also thermoregulatory, goes well in summer as well as winter, and softens over time."
      strong26: "tencel"
      liste26: " (or lyocell), is extracted from the pulp of eucalyptus wood. It is reminiscent of silk by its appearance and its touch. It is wrinkle-resistant and easy to maintain as it can be machine washed at 60 ° C."
      texte4: "Thanks to the various blogs and wiki which allowed me to document myself on the subject."
    labels:
      title: "THE LABELS"
      img1: "Lots of labels!"
      texte1: "Why are you interested in textile labels?"
      texte2: "In an ecological and sustainable approach of course. Even if it means doing craftsmanship as much to do it well and above all to choose its raw materials in all conscience. The textile industry uses a quarter of the chemicals in the world and has been accused 20% of water pollution by industry, which makes it the second largest freshwater polluter on the planet, which is why in addition to standards and regulations, labels have a role to play, in terms of supporting brands, and also as a guarantee of quality for end consumers. Thank you to all those who have already written on the subject, blogs and others where I have documented myself to offer you the widest range of possibilities. "
      texte3: "Each label verifies and prioritizes one or more aspects of the value chain. From fabric production to the finished product. Here are some examples of areas where labels specialize:"
      liste1: "Ecology - Environmental protection - Ethical and sustainable approach - CSR"
      liste2: "Social - Respect for the human condition"
      liste3: "Fair trade"
      liste4: "Organic origin - Products certified without pesticides - Ecological leather - Vegan products"
      liste5: "Health"
      texte4: "The textile industry being one of the most polluting in the world, the label industry was soon going to get started. Always greener than green .... But what do we do? sell ??? And yes, buying labeled fabrics or wools / yarns has a cost that the end consumer will have to pay. So you might as well know them to choose the right one. "
      texte5: "So thank you to all those who wrote on the subject and allowed me to document myself ... The wiki is your best friend ..."
      texte6: "I will therefore make a small list for you by detailing the two main ones since if I have to trust a label, it will be one of these two .... Afterwards for wool, certified or not, I prefer always a small French breeder, or fillature, at least we are not sure to favor French breeding and we do not avoid the carbon cost (especially since some labels like AB, have nothing to do with the French AB). ..Anyway, back on topic !!!!"
      texte7: "GOTS for"
      img2: "Global Organic Textil Standard"
      texte8: "is for me the reference in the matter. It is a label which one finds rather in the UK, the USA and Japan (I love their fabrics). Since 2008 it aims to harmonize the standards of the textile sector worldwide. And it interests me particularly since it has the most stringent specifications for wool, cotton, silk, hemp (linen is missing ... but hey). independent to control the application of the specifications that the producer has undertaken to respect. "
      texte9: "Each production has its own notebook of course; but overall we find for what is prohibited:"

      liste31: "Plastisol printing methods using phthalates and PVC."
      texte10: "For what is inevitable, the eco-label makes concessions without however bending to the law of the market. So to speak, the GOTS certification seeks to limit their use with measures such as:"
      liste40: "Watering cotton crops which must be reasoned,"
      liste41: "Wastewater that must be treated in a treatment plant,"
      liste42: "Packaging which must be recyclable."
      texte11: "As far as social matters are concerned, it goes without saying (-but certainly not that much since it must be said, again everything depends on the country of origin ^^) that forced labor, children and discrimination is prohibited, in addition to that the recommendations of the ILO (international labor organization), namely decent hours and wages, the right to organize, and hygiene and safety conditions "
      strong1: "And what I particularly appreciate as a customer, wear tests, because to be logical the garment must be able to last over time, in order to limit its production and its environmental impact."

      texte14: "We find it in different forms"
      texte15: "The ÖKO-TEX standard 100 label helps protect the consumer. Indeed, labeled products are free from chemicals that could be toxic to the consumer such as formaldehydes or heavy metals, for example. This international label is widely used especially for bed linen for young children. "
      texte16: "There is also the ÖKO-TEX standard 1000 label which certifies that production respects the environment during all its stages."
      texte17: "Finally, ÖKO-TEX standard 100 plus certifies that labeled products are free of toxic substances and come from environmentally friendly production."

      texte20: "Thanks to the use of a number"

      liste2: to participate in the recycling of clothes, the second most polluting industry in the world, and a lot of clothes are hardly worn before being thrown away,
      liste3: and in order to stay in the idea, we have also developed a zero-waste range that will help you eliminate the plastic from your daily life (bulk bag, charlotte flat or bee-wraps ...) and make long-term savings.
      texte3: Our suppliers are chosen with the greatest care to meet our many requirements.We try as much as possible to work with wools / threads / fabrics labeled GOTS, or Okéo-tex, after which we always favor productions in order to limit carbon emissions
