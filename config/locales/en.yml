      title: "THE LABELS"
      para1: "The textile industry being one of the most polluting in the world, the label industry was soon to get started.
              Always greener than green .... But what are we being sold ??? "
      para2: "So thank you to everyone who wrote on the subject and allowed me to document myself ... The wiki is your best friend ..."
      para3: "So I'm going to make you a little list by detailing the two main ones since if I have to trust a label, this
              ra one of these two .... After for wool, certified or not, I always favor a small French breeder, or
              childbirth ... in short let's go back to our sheep !!!! "
      para4: "GOTS for"
      img1: "GOTS logo"
      para5: "For me, this is the benchmark in this area. Since 2008, it has aimed to harmonize standards in the textile sector worldwide.
              And he particularly interests me since he has the strictest specifications concerning wool,
              cotton, silk, hemp (flax missing ... but good). In addition, it calls on independent organizations to carry out
              control of the application of the chahier of charges that the producer has undertaken to respect. "
      para6: "For each production its notebook of course but on the whole we find for what is prohibited:"
      li1: "Heavy metals as a whole,"
      li2: "Endocrine disruptors,"
      li3: "Brominated or chlorinated flame retardants,"
      li4: "Genetically modified organisms or GMOs,"
      li5: "Nanotechnology,"
      li6: "Carcinogens,"
      li7: "PVC,"
      li8: "Nickel,"
      li9: "Chromium,"
      li10: "Printing methods using aromatic solvents,"
      li11: "Plastisol printing methods using phthalates and PVC."
      para7: "For what is inevitable, the eco-label makes concessions without however yielding to the law of the market. So to speak,
              GOTS certification seek to limit their use with measures such as: "
      li20: "Watering cotton crops that must be reasoned,"
      li21: "The wastewater that must be treated in a wastewater treatment plant,"
      li22: "The packaging which must be recyclable."
      para8: "As for the social, it goes without saying (-but surely not that much since it must be said) that forced labor,
              children and discrimination are prohibited, in addition to the recommendations of the ILO (international organization of
              work), ie decent hours and wages, the right to organize, and health and safety conditions. "
      para9: "And what I particularly appreciate as a customer, wear tests, because to be logical the clothing must
              be able to last over time, in order to limit its production and its environmental impact. "
